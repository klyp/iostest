## iOS Developer Test

### Overview

The iOS Developer Test is a simple test we give our prospective iOS developers to see how they do given a coding task.

The premise is simple, create a simple app that performs a search on Rotten Tomatoes using the Search API for movies containing the word: “Apple”.

The output should be a ListView that displays each matching movies details (title, year, runtime) on a page.

* You may use any method/external libraries you wish to connect to the REST service.
* The list of results needs to be clean and easy to read.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your Github account (don't fork it please)
2. Create your iOS app source files, commit it and then push it to Github
3. Email us a link to your completed code
4. You're done!
